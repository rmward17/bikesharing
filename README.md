# NYC CitiBike Story
## Overview
Kate wants to implement a bikesharing business in Des Moines, Iowa. In order to get the potential angel investor on board, I used citibike data from New York City to build a Tablaue Story for Kate to present to the investor. 

## results
In order to show the investor that this is a good idea, I used data from August 2019 becuase summer is a very popular time for the bikes. The dataset was large and had a lot of information ready to use. Below are the visualization I built for Kate's presention.

### Peak Hours

In this bar chart, we can see clearly when the peak usage hours are. Using this information we can determine a variety of things including what time of day to service bikes, when to increase the price to ride, and when to offer discounts. 

### Gender Breakdown

Here we can see the breakdown of the gender of riders. It looks to be ~65% Male, ~25% Female, and ~10% unknown. This could be that in the summer, Women could be wearing dresses or sandals and are not planning to ride bikes in those clothing while men are typically in shorts and sneakers. In order to provide more access for riders that may not feel that are in apprpriate wear, we could work with the manufacturer to create pedals that won't hurt those in open toed shoes.

### Checkout Times
Knowing when and for how long the bikes are being used is important. It shows often and how long the bikes are being used and will help us determine how many bikes we should plan to have in our own system.

We can see that trip durations are within an hour. This is great information but I did another visualization to view the breakout by gender.

Here we can see that the peak trip duration is about the same regardless of gender but females tend to use the bikes for less time than males.

### Trips by Weekday Per Hour
We thouoght it was important to understand the weekly breakdown of the rides. The next few visualizations will help us understand what to expect in regards to the daily nd weekly usade of our own bikesharing system.

In the heatmap above, we can see that the most commons times people are using the bikes are to and from work or school and all day during the weekends.

In these heatmaps, we can see the above map broken out by gender. This shows that the usage times are pretty similar reagrdless of gender.

![User Trips by Gender by Day](https://github.com/rmward17/bikesharing/blob/main/Story%20Images/UserTripsByGenderbyDay.png)

In this heatmap, we can see that most of the subscribers versus one time users are using the bikes almost daily. Once more we see that it is mostly men and there are mostly rides during the week. It seems that the bike share system is the prefered mode of transporations for a lot of NYC residents.

## Summary
Based on the visualizations above, we can see that a bikesharing system is cost effective for the users and a huge potenatial business opportunity. As the rides may be cheap, the large number of consutomers will generate a hefty profit as well as allow people more access to an envirnmenally freindly and healthy form of transportation. Other visualizations I would have made is a breakdown of checkout times by User Type as well as seeing the gender breakdown with in those user types to determine how long our subscribers are using the bikes versus one time riders and if there is a way to draw in more female or male subscribers.
